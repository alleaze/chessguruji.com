            ● “Every chess master was once a beginner.” – Irving Chernev</p>
            ● “Chess holds its master in its own bonds, shackling the mind
            and brain so that the inner freedom of the very strongest
            must suffer.” – Albert Einstein</p>

● “Play the opening like a book, the middlegame like a
magician, and the endgame like a machine.” – Rudolph

move he makes.” – David Shenk</p>
● “When you see a good move, look for a better one.” –

● “A strong memory, concentration, imagination, and a strong
will is required to become a great chess player.” - Bobby
Fischer</p>
● “We cannot resist the fascination of sacrifice, since a

first what you are good at.”- Viswanathan Anand</p>
